This project was developed as an academic mini-project under the
Electronics and Communication Engineering curriculum (VTU) and
later extended into a research work published in an IEEE conference.

The system focuses on biometric fingerprint authentication integrated
with a microcontroller to ensure secure, automated, and reliable
exam hall access control.
